Machine Learning Projects:

1. PCA from scratch:
It contains the Principal Component Analysis implementation from scratch and the results are verified with the implementation in scikit-learn library.

2. Eigen Face:
It demonstrates the application of PCA in face detection. Highest eight Principal Component variations are shown in the project. The dataset used is CelebA which can be obtained from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.

3. Handwritten Digit Recognition:
Three neural network models are implemented. Two of them are simple neural networks and one includes a complete CNN model.
